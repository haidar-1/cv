                    <p>Above all, a technology expert with 20 years of work experience, from networking to front-end development, people/project management and instructor. 
                        Found biggest of all passions when able to put all of those skills together as a <strong>Cyber Security expert</strong>, helping out on that for the last decade. 
                        Working for the last five years as <strong>Systems Engineer</strong> at Cyber Security vendor Fortinet, I was able to add sales to the mix of skills, and 
                        found the sweet spot: learner, instructor, developer, security consultor, sales consultor, project manager and a little of an innovator, leading bold initiatives. 
                        For short, doing what I can with what I got to make the lives of my customers, partners and co-workers a little better.</p></td>
